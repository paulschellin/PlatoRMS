The Plato Semantic Resource Management System


# DISCLAIMER #

This repository contains no end-user code. It contains almost no code that would be interesting to a developer. This repository is effectively the scratchpad in which I've been tinkering with early design decisions for Plato.

I pushed this repository to github as a type of commitment device for myself. I found that it can be easy to let myself become complacent when there is no externally-observable evidence of progress. Hopefully the commitment device is effective.

If you are interested in looking through my scratchwork, be my guest -- but be warned that there is a large amount of dead code, and a large deficit of documentation. I hope to work on that throughout September/October 2014.
